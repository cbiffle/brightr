# `brightr`: change backlight on Linux

This is a very simple command line tool for changing the backlight on a Linux
system.

To build this, you will need Rust installed (ideally through Rustup). You can
try it out by running

```
cargo run
```

or install it with your other Cargo binaries using

```
cargo install --path . --locked
```

The command line interface currently looks like this (run without arguments, or
with `help`, to get the current instructions):

```
Adjust display backlight. All values are in percentages unless overridden
using -r/--raw

Usage: brightr [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  get   Print the current backlight setting in the format "x/y",
            where x is the current setting, and y is the max
  set   Set the backlight to a specific value
  up    Increase the backlight brightness relative to its current
            level
  down  Decrease the backlight brightness relative to its current
            level
  help  Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -n, --name <NAME>  Name of backlight device to adjust. Use this to
                     override the automatic detection logic
  -r, --raw          Use the driver's raw brightness values instead of
                     percentage
  -p, --picky        Exit with a non-zero status if the requested
                     brightness would be out of range for the device.
                     This can be useful for detecting when the top or
                     bottom of the scale has been reached, to provide
                     user feedback
  -h, --help         Print help
```
